# google-homepage

This is part of the Odin Project. It is required to replicate Google's Homepage.
For this I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap following an online tutorial by https://www.youtube.com/c/EasyTutorialsVideo
Main concepts used are loading bootstrap and fonts fron CDN, building HTML structure and building CSS on an ordered fashion.
